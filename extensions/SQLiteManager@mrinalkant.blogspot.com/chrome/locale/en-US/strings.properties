confirm.changeSchemaVersion=The schema-version is usually only manipulated internally by SQLite. It is incremented by SQLite whenever the database schema is modified (by creating or dropping a table or index). The schema version is used by SQLite each time a query is executed to ensure that the internal cache of the schema used when compiling the SQL query matches the schema of the database against which the compiled query is actually executed. Subverting this mechanism by using 'PRAGMA schema_version' to modify the schema-version is potentially dangerous and may lead to program crashes or database corruption. Use with caution!

q.proceed=Do you still want to proceed?
