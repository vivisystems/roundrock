pmount (0.9.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

    - pmount-hal: Minor change to build with dbus 0.91.
    - pmount: If pmount is installed setgid, use pmount's group for gid mount
      option, otherwise use the user's group, as usual (patch from Wilhelm Meier
      <wilhelm.meier@fh-kl.de>).
    - pmount: Consider devices on pcmcia bus as hotpluggable (and thus
      pmountable). (https://launchpad.net/bugs/50226)
    - Fix automake file to ship README.devel.
    - Fix default path of /etc/pmount.allow (regression from 0.9.12).

pmount (0.9.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - pmount: Refuse to mount devices to a mount point that is already in
      /etc/fstab.

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Fix processing of hal's mount options. (patch was already applied in
      previous version).
    - pmount-hal: Directly call mount for devices in /etc/fstab. This allows

    - Document PMOUNT_DEBUG environment variable in pmount-hal manpage.

    - Fix processing of hal's mount options.
    - Patch taken from bzr head.
    - Closes: #330462
  * Remove debian/pmount.dirs so that /media is not owned by pmount any more
    (base-files creates it nowadays). Create /media in the postinst instead if
    it does not exist. Closes: #355405

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Mar 2006 19:15:35 +0100

pmount (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, only fixes two major bugs in pmount-hal:
    - Fix crash for label-less volumes with hal 0.5.7.
    - Assign a proper mount point to devices with empty labels (with hal
      0.5.7, they became /media/-1).

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Mar 2006 17:38:07 +0100

pmount (0.9.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Fix race condition with several parallel pmount instances which could
      cause double mounts to the same mount point. Also, pmount-hal now
      handles this case gracefully and reattempts pmount call with a fresh
      label. (Ubuntu #14415)
    - pmount-hal: Use storage.policy.mount_filesystem as a fallback if
      volume.policy.mount_filesystem does not exist. (Ubuntu #14848)

pmount (0.9.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - pmount-hal: Ported to new dbus 0.3x/hal 0.5.x APIs.
    - Supports mounting LUKS encrypted devices with LUKS capable cryptsetup
      package (which is not in Debian yet, though).
    - pmount-hal: Now read volume.policy.mount_filesystem instead of
      volume.fstype. Closes: #306332
    - pmount-hal: Now read umask setting from hal. Closes: #310228, #296914
    - Now mount VFAT with shortnames=winnt. Closes: #310618

      Closes: #312822
  * Droped debian/patches/02-async_by_default.patch: This is upstream now.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Jul 2005 13:25:06 +0200

pmount (0.8-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high since this fixes an RC bug, the fix should reach Sarge.
  * Added debian/patches/02-async_by_default.patch:
    - Mount devices 'async' by default instead of 'sync'. This will avoid
      physical damage of flash chips due to exaggerated updating of inode/FAT
      structures and greatly speed up the write throughput. On the bad side
      this makes it much less safe to remove devices without proper umounting.
    - Replace option "--async" with option "--sync".
    - Document change in the manpages.
    - Closes: #309591
  * debian/control: Correct package priority to optional, to match the katie
    overrides.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 18 May 2005 15:41:13 +0200

pmount (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Unbreak locking. (closes: #302174)
    - More symmetry between pmount and pumount: pumount now works with label
      name, pmount with a complete mount path (only in /media).
      (closes: #299468)
    - Now supports --umask option. (part of #296914)
  * debian/pmount.postinst: Remove .created_by_pmount stamps from
    /var/lock/pmount to clean up broken locking from versions < 0.8.
    (see #302174)
  * Compile with Sarge's dbus-1 version, since version 0.23.4 is not yet
    available on all platforms. (closes: #303291)

pmount (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Apr 2005 18:02:35 +0200

pmount (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release: pmount-hal now reuses an existing
    /media/<label> directory if it only contains a ".created-by-pmount" stamp
    file, which makes it work with unmounts using umount instead of pumount
    (which happens at reboot/shutdown).

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Feb 2005 11:40:59 +0100

pmount (0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Added build dependency libhal-dev, the new pmount-hal (which is now
    written in C) needs it.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Feb 2005 15:53:00 +0100

pmount (0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - now mounts vfat file systems with the "quiet" option (closes: #291645)
    - pmount-hal now uses the file system provided by hal (if present) instead
      of always autodetecting it; this saves some time and also avoids
      confusing kernel log error messages (closes: #287815)
    - now supports pmount/pumounting by mount point
    - new translations
  * Explain the "plugdev" group in README.Debian and in the manpages (patched
    by 01-man-plugdev.patch.patch). (closes: #288957)
  * postinst: Check for existence of group 'plugdev' before calling 'adduser'
    to avoid confusing warnings.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Jan 2005 09:36:04 +0100

pmount (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - do not allow empty media labels; this allowed to mount a
      device directly under /media if /media was empty (closes: #288644)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Jan 2005 12:44:46 +0100

pmount (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, see upstream changelog for details
    - does not remove directories it did not create (closes: #286936)

      one to support nicer names from symlinks (closes: #286695)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Nov 2004 16:12:41 +0100

pmount (0.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * pmount.postinst:
    - simplified, the "plugdev" group approach is now used in both Debian and
      Ubuntu
    - protected adduser call with || true; this seems to fail on some weird
      systems if the group already exists (closes: #282145)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Nov 2004 16:49:33 +0100

pmount (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
