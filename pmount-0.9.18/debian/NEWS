pmount (0.9.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The symlink lookup for /etc/fstab has been disabled. If you were
  relying on the presence of a /etc/fstab entry to prevent your users
  from mounting a device, please make sure that the entry in
  /etc/fstab does not reference a symlink (see pmount (1) for more
  details).

pmount (0.9.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from release 0.9.16-1, pmount supports globs in the
  /etc/pmount.allow configuration file. This means in particular that
  you should check if there wasn't any devices with *, [] or ? inside
  that shouldn't be interpreted as globs. It is however quite unlikely.
