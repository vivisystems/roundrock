pmount for Debian
-----------------

To restrict the ability to mount arbitrary devices to selected
"Desktop" users, the Debian package for pmount restricts the execution
of pmount and pumount to members of the group "plugdev".

So, for every user who should be able to execute pmount, please
execute the following command (as root):

   adduser <user> plugdev

(with replacing "<user>" by the respective user login).
