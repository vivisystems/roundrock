We have decided to use a boost-style configuration system for libsmbios. The
headers in and below this directory are mostly imported from boost with all
"BOOST" prefixes changed to LIBSMBIOS.

Please ensure that all copyright information from boost.org is retained. Add a
message about libsmbios modifying it and importing it. Boost has a BSD-Style
license, so there should be no problem using portions of their code. Please
ensure that boost code is contained under this directory, though.
