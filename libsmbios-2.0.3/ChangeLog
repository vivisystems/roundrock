* Wed Jan 9 2008 Michael E Brown <michael_e_brown at dell.com> - 2.0.0
- ABI incompatible, minor API changes
- sync up libsmbios soname with version #
- move binaries to /usr/sbin as they are only runnable by root
- drop libsmbiosxml lib as it was mostly unused.
- drop autotools generated files out of git and add autogen.sh
- drop tokenCtl binary-- pysmbios has a *much* improved version

* Wed Aug 22 2007 Michael E Brown <michael_e_brown at dell.com> - 0.13.9
- Fix a couple of failure-to-check-return on fopen. most were unit-test code
  only, but two or three were in regular code.
- Add hinting to the memory class, so that it can intelligently close /dev/mem
  file handle when it is not needed (which is most of the time). it only
  leaves it open when it is scanning, so speed is not impacted.
