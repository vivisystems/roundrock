    - spec file improvements
    - makefile improvements: build less, remote build
    - website updates
    - compile fix for RHEL4 x86_64
 - 2005-09-19 Released version 0.10.4_beta5
    - Added downloadable dell_rbu and dcdbas dkms driver RPMS.
    - Re-arrange website downloads page a bit to make things easier to find.
 - 2005-09-19 Released version 0.10.4_beta4
    - Added "dell_rbu" kernel driver to libsmbios source tree (under "kernel/"
      dir) for people who do not have 2.6.14-rc kernels. Packet support is
      still disabled by default as it has not been tested. Monolithic mode
      works on all machines that support packet, so this should not be a
      problem.
    - Removed XML output from dumpSmbios and created a new unsupported binary,
      "dumpSmbios_IPS" that has the old format XML output.
    - Add "probes" unsupported, proof-of-concept binary. Can dump temperature
      sensors on some Dell machines, such as laptops. After things settle
      down a bit, I will be trying to add support to lmsensors. This bin is
      definetly not complete, nor is it up to coding standards.
 - 2005-09-16 Released version 0.10.4_beta3
    - Dell BIOS update using Linux dell_rbu driver.
        - dell_rbu driver is in 2.6.14-rc1.
        - packet rbu is coded but untested. Currently I force monolithic mode
          which must be manually overridden on the cmdline to try packet.
        - See the DOCS: \ref dellBiosUpdate
    - XML output still experimental. 
    - document some token id values: \ref token
 - 2005-09-12 Released version 0.10.4_beta2
    - possible cmos corruption issue fixed.  Changed code so that it should
      always fail in a much more obvious way in the future, rather than having
      a potentially hidden bug.
    - XML output still experimental. Discussions on final format are still
      ongoing.
    - port from xerces to libxml2 started. 
    - completely dynamic addition of new platforms to unit test suite.
    - small warnings fixes for .NET 2003 compiler for /w4. 
    - new tokenCtl binary -- still under development.
    - fix for broken createUnitTestFiles binary.
 - 2005-09-08 Released version 0.10.4_beta1
    - new "wakeupCtl" binary, contributed by David Greaves.
    - XML output from dumpSmbios. Use the "-x" option for XML output.
        - feedback requested. I'm still working on the format for the XML
          output.
    - Initial support for VC++ .NET 2003. Not yet fully complete, but project
      files are there. Compiles, not fully tested yet. Thanks to Sean-Marc
      Castruita for providing the build machine with VC .NET.

 - 2005-09-06 Released version 0.10.3
    - Good things always come in threes. :-)
    - Fix so that people that include only "SystemInfo.h" get all the
      automagical microsoft library linking mojo. Also fix systeminfo.h so
      that it can sucessfully be included by C programs.

 - 2005-09-06 Released version 0.10.2
    - Fix libsmbios_minimal.dsw (VC6 project file) to remove XML-related libs.
      The minimal project should compile on all machines (no need for
      xerces/cppunit)
    - No code changes

 - 2005-09-06 Released version 0.10.1
    - XML output support removed until 0.10.2... needs more discussion
    - Released due to several teams build deadlines. Main new features are:
        - WMI support on Windows (set LIBSMBIOS_WIN_USE_WMI to use, must have
          platform SDK installed)
        - Automatic library selection on Windows. No need to add
          "smbios_lib.lib" manually to library link list. Including any
          libsmbios header will automatically select the right lib to link
          against by looking at your build settings (single thread, debug
          single thread, multithread, debug multithread, etc.)
        - libsmbios_minimal.dsw workspace for VC6. Only builds the core libs
          that have no external dependencies.
        - Even more parallel builds. WARNING: do not run "make -j all" on a
          low-powered machine, as it spawns over 100 g++ instances and can
          easily bring down non-server machine. My dual-P4 HT-enabled 2.8GHz 
          server barely handles it. :-)
    - 100% unit test pass on Linux. One unit test failure on Windows (BIOS
      bug, not a libsmbios bug.
    - Passes valgrind memcheck with no errors, as do all libsmbios releases
      :-)

 - 2005-09-06 Released version 0.10.1_beta3
    - EXPERIMENTAL: XML output from dumpSmbios. Still working on this feature,
      so it is subject to change
    - Unit Test 100% pass (Linux-only): Merged patch from Senthil Or to allow skipping of
      unit tests that are known to fail. Used this patch to skip the one
      failing lattitude unit test. Found workarounds or fixes for the rest of
      the failing unit tests. The skip patch only works for Linux, so Windows
      will still have one failing unit test.
 - 2005-09-04 Released version 0.10.1_beta2
    - Compile fix for WMI code.
    - Library auto-selection: groups using the windows version of libsmbios no
      longer need to add "smbios_lib.lib" to their library list. Instead,
      #including any of the libsmbios header files will automatically setup
      the correct lib to use. Libs are compiled for both single-thread and
      multi-thread as well as debug/nondebug.
 - 2005-09-03 Released version 0.10.1_beta1
    - New code to allow pulling SMBIOS table from WMI on Windows. Must have
      Windows Platform SDK installed to compile. Set LIBSMBIOS_WIN_USE_WMI to
      enable.

 - 2005-09-03 Released version 0.10.0
    - Final release for 0.10.0. Two unused var warnings fixed for windows
      compile. No other changes from -beta5.


 - 2005-09-02 Released version 0.10.0-beta5
    - Fixed compile for Windows in -beta4, but that subtly broke SMI calls.
      Fixed.
 - 2005-09-02 Released version 0.10.0-beta4
    - Fixed bug in the passwordII handling. Password verification should work
      on all systems now.
    - Worked on all message output from the tag binaries. All error messages
      should be much more helpful now.
 - 2005-09-01 Released version 0.10.0-beta3
    - REMOVED beta3 from download site due to problem promoting beta4... forgot
      to bump version :-(
    - Automatic conversion of ASCII passwords to en_US keyboard scan codes, 
      where necessary.
    - Addition of --rawpassword cmdline arg to override scan code conversion
      for cases where keyboard is not en_US. (Manual conversion is necessary)
    - Much better error reporting for the supported tag-setting executables.
    - CALL FOR TESTERS: please see release announcement mail sent to the
      mailing list. I would like help testing the SMI password functions
      across more machines.
 - 2005-08-30 Released version 0.10.0-beta2
    - created supported-bins/ dir where 'official' bins go. All bins in this
      dir must meed coding standards guidelines and be reviewed. 
    - Add new SMI support. Added support for many new smi functions. There is
      a 'smitest' binary to show some of these, but it is not meant for
      production use yet.
    - password support for SMI calls is implemented, not tested across all
      systems yet. see getPasswordFormat/ascii2enUS_scancode/verifyPassword
      binaries.
    - CALL FOR TESTERS: please see release announcement mail sent to the
      mailing list. I would like help testing the SMI password functions
      across more machines.
 - 2005-08-24 Released version 0.10.0-beta1
    - Small build fixes:
        - fix parallel builds
        - fix unnecessary error message for missing *.d files
        - remove untested compiler warning when using gcc4
        - massive cleanup of unnecessary header #include's 
        - hide several LowLevel headers that shouldn't have been in public API
    - API/ABI Changes: IException and subclasses
        - fix exception class to properly propogate message up
        - remove unused messageId field
    - API/ABI Changes: initial support for 0xD5/0xD6 protected CMOS tokens
        - Does not support changing token value when there is a BIOS
          password set. This is being worked on still.
        - Throws a "NeedAuthentication" exception when password protection
          is present. Use the ->tryPassword() function on the token when
          this exception is thrown. (not yet fully implemented.)
    - API/ABI Changes to prepare for adding SMI access to 0xDA SMI tokens
    - New SMI access subclass, uses beta version of open-source "dcdbas" driver.
    - API/ABI change summary: 
        - ICmosToken -> IToken
        - ICmosTokenTable -> ITokenTable
        - ICmosTokenTableFactory -> ITokenTableFactory
        - libraries/cmostoken -> libraries/token
        - CMOS-specific functions removed from IToken and moved to a
          subclass

 - 2005-08-05 Released version 0.9.2 
        - add SMBIOSSetAssetTag() function and assetTag binary. 
        - Note: This API is not yet considered "stable" and is subject to change
        - Note: Asset tag is settable via SMI and CMOS access methods. Only CMOS is implemented in libsmbios at this time.
        - Note: CMOS based functions work only on Linux at present. Need volunteer to write Windows CMOS access code.

 - 2005-07-28 Released version 0.9.1 
        - minor build updates, doc updates.  
        - fix for cppunit 1.10.2. 
        - More platform unit tests. 
        - StdSmbiosXml.h is now packaged so Windows compiles should work out of the box.

 - 2005-06-21 Released version 0.9.0 -- First open source release!

 - 2005-06-21 Publicly available mailing list: http://lists.us.dell.com/mailman/listinfo/libsmbios-devel
