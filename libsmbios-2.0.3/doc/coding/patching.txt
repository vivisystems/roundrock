\page patches How to submit a patch

\section what_patch What is a patch?

A patch is a way that you can make changes to the libsmbios code and send just
your changes to the libsmbios development team. The team can see the lines
of code that you changed, so they don't need to hunt through the code to see
what changed. You can also use the patch to apply the changes to the official
code base.

You create a patch by downloading the source code for libsmbios and working on
coding up your changes. 

\subsection patch_tarball Creating a patch from tarball
    need to finish this section. :-)

\section verify_patch How do I verify my changes.

There are several requirements for any proposed change to libsmbios. The
requirements are very easy to fulfill. The list of requirements are below. Any
patch not including all of these items will be rejected.

- <b>Update TODO file</b>
- <b>Update doxygen </b>
- <b>Add unit tests for new code</b> 
- <b>Verify code coverage for new code</b> <pre>make coverage</pre>
- <b>Run all unit tests before submission</b> <pre>make unit_test</pre>
- <b>Run memory leak detection before submission</b> <pre>make valgrind</pre>
