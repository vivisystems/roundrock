Indentation and tabbing policy:
    - Indentation is 4 spaces, no tab characters are allowed
    - the reference indentation policy is in build/scripts/indent.sh. The
      "Artistic Style" (astyle) program is an automated indentation engine 
      that will re-tab and re-indent C++ code. The appropriate settings to 
      use are contained in the indent.sh script. This script should be run on
      new code to assure that it follows the project policy. The script will
      occasionally be re-run against old code to ensure that it stays within
      guidelines.

 Use modelines: Ensure that every file has a complete set of modelines for
 common editors. VIM modelines should appear in every file. When we get
 a significant set of developers using EMACS, then appropriate modelines for
 EMACS should be added to each file

 Modelines should be in the first or last 5 lines of the program text. Modelines
 in other locations are generally ignored by editors.

example emacs modeline:
\verbatim
/* -*- Mode: C; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4 -*-
\endverbatim

example vim modeline:
\verbatim
// vim:expandtab:autoindent:tabstop=4:shiftwidth=4:filetype=txt:
\endverbatim
