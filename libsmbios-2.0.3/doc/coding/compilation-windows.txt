 \section req_comp_win Compilation requirements

 In order to compile libsmbios from source, you need to have the following
 available on your system:
 - cppunit 1.8.0 or higher (tested with 1.8.0 and 1.10.2)
    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/
 - xerces 2.3 or higher (tested with 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6)
    http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html

 The following items are not strictly necessary to do a build, but are highly
 recommended:
 - GraphViz: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
 - Doxygen: http://www.doxygen.org/


 \section win_comp Windows 
   Libsmbios has been tested with the following compilers on Windows:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
   - Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003

   A workspace is available under build/VC6/ to assist in compiling on Visual
   C++. 

   A workspace is available under build/VC.NET_2003/ to compile on VC.NET
   2003.

   Several environment variables need to be set for the VC .NET 2003 build.
   There is a sample batch file to set these variables and start the IDE here:
   <a href="http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/download/windows/dev_environment">http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/download/windows/dev_environment</a>. 
   Also included are pre-compiled versions (with source) of xerces and
   cppunit, so everything that you need to compile all of the tools is there.
