\section NAME NAME
serviceTag

\section SYNOPSIS SYNOPSIS

The serviceTag executable is used to read or write Dell system service tags. 
Service tags are generally either 5 or 7 characters and are set at the Dell
factory to the Dell-managed service tag number. This tag should not be set by
end-users, as it is used for service and support purposes.

Note that some systems do not allow setting of service tag outside of the Dell
factory.

<pre>

    $ ./serviceTagS -s foobar1
    Existing Service Tag:
    Changing Service Tag: foobar1
    Change Successful. The changes may not take effect until reboot, depending on
    system type.
