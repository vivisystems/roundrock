/*! \page propertyTag Documentation for propertyTag executable

\section NAME NAME
propertyTag

\section SYNOPSIS SYNOPSIS

The propertyTag executable is used to read or write the Dell property
ownership tags. Property ownership tags are generally 80-characters and can be
set to any value by the system owner. This tag is displayed across the screen
during BIOS POST through system bootup. It is also displayed if the system has
an admin/user password set that must be entered to continue bootup.

The propertyTag executable relies on the "dcdbas" kernel-mode driver. This
driver is included in Linux kernels starting at 2.6.14. A dkms package is
provided in the libsmbios package for earlier 2.6.x kernels.

<pre>
    $ ./propertyTag
    Existing Property Tag:

    $ ./propertyTagS -s "New property ownership tag."
    Existing Property Ownership Tag:
    Changing Property Ownership Tag: New property ownership tag.
    Change Successful. The changes may not take effect until reboot, depending on
    system type.
