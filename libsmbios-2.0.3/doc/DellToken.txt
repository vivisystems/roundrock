# <pre>
#
# The following is a list of Dell Tokens and their descriptions.
# meant to (eventually) be parsed by tokenCtl. :-)
#
# It is pretty slow entering these in, so it will probably take a while to get
# them all. 
# 
# Also note, this covers both SMI and CMOS tokens. No distinction is made
# between the two types.
