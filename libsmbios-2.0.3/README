To build, run "make all", or "make minimal". The 'all' target builds all 
libs and docs. The 'minimal' target only builds things with no external
dependencies (cppunit/xerces/doxygen).

Documentation is in doxygen format. To view the docs, run "make doxygen", then 
look in the docs/full/html/index.html, or the docs/interface/html/index.html.
Docs are also built as part of "make all".

These docs are posted on the web at http://.../.. (need permanent address here)
