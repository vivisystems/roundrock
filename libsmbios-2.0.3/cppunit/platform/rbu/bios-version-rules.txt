Old Style:
    Version is three ascii chars. Two-level sorting:

    1) First Letter: sort order: A > X > P > any other letter
    2) Second/Third letter: ASCII sorting order for the last two chars

New Style:
    Version is three numbers 0-99, separated by period.

    Three-level sorting:

    1) By first number. 90-99 are always sorted _LAST_. otherwise, sort numerically.
    2) By second number.
    3) By third number.
